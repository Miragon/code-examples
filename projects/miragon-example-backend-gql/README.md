# Miragon Example Backend
Miragon is your best choice for process automation projects. The Startup based in Augsburg is specialised in Software Development using the Camunda Process Engine and provides professional IT expertise. Visit our website: https://www.miragon.io/ </br>

This project is part of our blog post series, in which we show how to implement various challenging requirements with the highest code quality.

## 1. Project structure
This backend application allows managing projects, which represent an object containing the customers name and his address. 
Using the APIs endpoints, a client is able to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) his projects.

### 1.1 Domain 'project'
We are separating our domains always according the different layers an object representation has to go through:
- **api**: Layer of the transport object (TO). We'll receive the object in a json format at our published resource (the controller) and map it to an internal representation.
- **domain**: Core Layer using internal object representation. Used for communication with external services, notifying clients, sending object to local database, ... .
- **infrastructure**: Layer for storing the object entities. Its repositories provide a mechanism for the communication with the database, called Java Persistence API (JPA).

### 1.2 Shared functionality
The `shared` package contains cross domain functionality:
- **Exception Handling**: Using the `ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`, internal Exceptions will be mapped to HTTP responses.
- **Security**: Using JSON Web Token (JWT) in combination with Auth0 to secure the endpoints.
- **Api-Docu**: Swagger provides our api-doku at: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html

## 2. Running this project
To keep the disparity between dev and prod as small as possible, we're using an nginx in front of our application and save the data in a postgres-db.
Both tools have to be run before you can start the project. Download docker and run:
```bash
echo "alias dc='docker compose'" >> ~/.zshrc #~/.bashrc on linux
. ~/.zshrc
dc up -d
dc down #stop services
```

### 2.1 NoSecurity profile
To run this project in development mode use the Spring Boot noSecurity profile: </br>
In intelliJ -> Edit Configurations... -> Active Profile: "no-security"

### 2.2 Using Auth0
1. Visit https://auth0.com and create an account (basic functionality is free)
1. Create a tenant and get its domain: f.ex. `miragon-example-tenant.eu.auth0.com`
1. Ether set your auth0-domain in application-properties like
   ```
   spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=https://miragon-example-tenant.eu.auth0.com/
   ```
   or overwrite this variable in your RunConfigurations
1. In Auth0: Go to Applications -> APIs -> Test and click on "Create Test Application". You can now use the request to get a valid token via Postman.
1. Use the token for requests against this API. The following example was exported from Postman:
    ```
   curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/project' \
    --header 'accept: */*' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGc.....' \
    --data-raw '{"customer":"Grandma Uschi","address":"Spitalgasse 15, 86150 Augsburg"}'
   ```
